00:00.080 --> 00:01.760
you're born into open water and you

00:01.760 --> 00:03.600
start moving instantly your body tips

00:03.600 --> 00:05.440
forward and your head lifts just enough

00:05.440 --> 00:07.279
to spot your mother swimming ahead so

00:07.279 --> 00:08.639
you start following her you don't know

00:08.639 --> 00:10.160
why you're doing it but your body keeps

00:10.160 --> 00:11.679
matching her position and your path

00:11.679 --> 00:13.599
lines up with hers as you swim forward

00:13.599 --> 00:15.360
then you get unlucky there's a dark

00:15.360 --> 00:16.880
shape ahead that starts getting bigger

00:16.880 --> 00:18.480
and at first it's hard to tell what it

00:18.480 --> 00:20.240
is it's coming straight toward you and

00:20.240 --> 00:22.160
it isn't turning or slowing down it's

00:22.160 --> 00:24.080
just getting closer every second you

00:24.080 --> 00:25.600
keep swimming until it's near enough for

00:25.600 --> 00:27.519
you to see the head and the teeth moving

00:27.519 --> 00:29.359
side to side and that's when you realize

00:29.359 --> 00:31.519
it's a shark it keeps coming and you try

00:31.519 --> 00:33.200
to swim faster but your body doesn't

00:33.200 --> 00:34.800
respond the way you want it to your

00:34.800 --> 00:36.559
muscles don't move evenly your head

00:36.559 --> 00:38.320
lifts too far and your tail pulls

00:38.320 --> 00:39.920
sideways before you can make another

00:39.920 --> 00:42.000
move you stop completely and freeze in

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
place the shark swims even closer but

00:44.000 --> 00:45.600
your mother sees it and turns then

00:45.600 --> 00:47.440
without waiting she swims forward

00:47.440 --> 00:49.120
straight at the shark from below two

00:49.120 --> 00:50.640
more females break from the group and

00:50.640 --> 00:52.559
follow behind her one slightly higher

00:52.559 --> 00:54.320
and the other wide to the left none of

00:54.320 --> 00:56.160
them change speed or position as they

00:56.160 --> 00:58.320
close in your mother hits first slamming

00:58.320 --> 01:00.000
into the shark's stomach to knock it off

01:00.000 --> 01:01.440
line while the others crash into the

01:01.440 --> 01:03.280
side one after the other hitting hard

01:03.280 --> 01:04.879
enough to push it off balance and turn

01:04.879 --> 01:06.799
its body away from you your mother spins

01:06.799 --> 01:08.400
back around and strikes it again near

01:08.400 --> 01:10.159
the head and this time the shark stops

01:10.159 --> 01:12.000
moving forward and begins to turn by the

01:12.000 --> 01:13.680
time she comes back around it's already

01:13.680 --> 01:15.200
swimming in the other direction she

01:15.200 --> 01:16.799
swims back to you and you move in behind

01:16.799 --> 01:18.479
her falling back into place just under

01:18.479 --> 01:20.320
her tail it's your first day and things

01:20.320 --> 01:21.759
are only going to get more interesting

01:21.759 --> 01:23.520
you're 1 month old now and you still

01:23.520 --> 01:25.040
swim beside your mother the others

01:25.040 --> 01:26.720
circle around you they move when she

01:26.720 --> 01:28.240
moves and close in when something feels

01:28.240 --> 01:30.080
off then a group of males cuts across

01:30.080 --> 01:31.600
the edge of the pod they don't slow down

01:31.600 --> 01:33.360
or keep their distance they chose your

01:33.360 --> 01:35.280
mother one slams into her shoulder and

01:35.280 --> 01:36.880
another drops low and drives straight

01:36.880 --> 01:39.119
into her belly she kicks and twists but

01:39.119 --> 01:40.880
they keep going hitting from both sides

01:40.880 --> 01:42.880
forcing her downward then one grabs hold

01:42.880 --> 01:44.479
and drags her deeper while the rest

01:44.479 --> 01:46.640
follow behind him you turn to follow but

01:46.640 --> 01:48.399
one of them sees you and blocks off your

01:48.399 --> 01:50.640
path he turns once and comes straight at

01:50.640 --> 01:52.560
you with his jaws open ready to bite

01:52.560 --> 01:54.320
he's not chasing you he's trying to take

01:54.320 --> 01:56.000
you out you freeze in place and brace

01:56.000 --> 01:57.600
your body but he keeps coming then your

01:57.600 --> 01:59.520
auntie slams into his side before he can

01:59.520 --> 02:01.280
reach you another one crashes into his

02:01.280 --> 02:03.280
ribs and a third rises from below and

02:03.280 --> 02:04.719
knocks him off balance with her head

02:04.719 --> 02:05.920
they don't chase him and they don't

02:05.920 --> 02:07.600
finish it they hit him once each and

02:07.600 --> 02:09.280
then return to the group you stay in the

02:09.280 --> 02:10.640
center and don't leave the formation

02:10.640 --> 02:12.239
thinking about what just happened you

02:12.239 --> 02:13.920
don't see your mother for 3 days she

02:13.920 --> 02:15.680
returns on the fourth her body covered

02:15.680 --> 02:17.760
in scrapes blood slipping down her side

02:17.760 --> 02:20.000
her movements are slow and uneven she

02:20.000 --> 02:21.360
doesn't look at anyone and she doesn't

02:21.360 --> 02:22.879
make a sound she just finds her place

02:22.879 --> 02:24.480
and keeps swimming forward you fall in

02:24.480 --> 02:26.400
beside her and stay there skip forward a

02:26.400 --> 02:28.000
bit and you're one year old now you've

02:28.000 --> 02:29.440
started to hunt but not because you're

02:29.440 --> 02:31.200
hungry and in need of food you just do

02:31.200 --> 02:32.720
it for fun you follow your mother

02:32.720 --> 02:34.319
through shallow water until she speeds

02:34.319 --> 02:36.319
up and moves towards a group of fish you

02:36.319 --> 02:37.840
break away from her side and chase one

02:37.840 --> 02:39.519
of the smaller fish that splits from the

02:39.519 --> 02:41.200
group she turns in from the opposite

02:41.200 --> 02:42.720
direction and cuts it off before it

02:42.720 --> 02:44.640
escapes you both move without needing to

02:44.640 --> 02:46.720
look she speeds up and you slow down she

02:46.720 --> 02:48.400
faints one way and you block the other

02:48.400 --> 02:50.080
the fish jolts every time one of you

02:50.080 --> 02:52.239
moves trapped in a loop it can't break

02:52.239 --> 02:54.000
and that's when the fun begins the fish

02:54.000 --> 02:55.840
darts forward and cuts left but you stay

02:55.840 --> 02:57.519
on it matching its path and pushing it

02:57.519 --> 02:59.040
toward open space where it can't turn

02:59.040 --> 03:01.040
back you hold position on one side while

03:01.040 --> 03:02.239
your mother comes in on the other

03:02.239 --> 03:04.400
forcing it into a trap it twists and

03:04.400 --> 03:06.000
tries to slip through a gap but you

03:06.000 --> 03:07.760
press in and close it off you lunge

03:07.760 --> 03:09.599
first and tear off a piece near the gill

03:09.599 --> 03:11.040
and your mother follows with a deeper

03:11.040 --> 03:12.560
bite through the middle you both turn

03:12.560 --> 03:14.400
and strike again hitting the same spots

03:14.400 --> 03:16.080
over and over until the fish stops

03:16.080 --> 03:18.159
resisting its muscles twitch then it

03:18.159 --> 03:19.840
floats and you swim away without

03:19.840 --> 03:21.519
finishing it you chase down another one

03:21.519 --> 03:23.360
on your own closing the distance fast

03:23.360 --> 03:25.040
and pinning it near the surface where it

03:25.040 --> 03:27.120
can't dive you block it from above cut

03:27.120 --> 03:28.879
its path below and wait for it to wear

03:28.879 --> 03:30.720
itself out when it slows down you grab

03:30.720 --> 03:32.400
it and hold it still you don't eat it

03:32.400 --> 03:34.080
you just want to feel it thrash then

03:34.080 --> 03:35.680
something moves near your tail another

03:35.680 --> 03:37.519
dolphin closes in fast from the right

03:37.519 --> 03:38.879
coming close enough that your bodies

03:38.879 --> 03:40.480
almost touch you tighten your grip on

03:40.480 --> 03:42.080
the fish and turn sharply across his

03:42.080 --> 03:44.080
path he follows for a moment but you

03:44.080 --> 03:45.519
hold your line and don't let him get

03:45.519 --> 03:47.680
close again he backs off and turns away

03:47.680 --> 03:49.519
you let the fish drop and watch him swim

03:49.519 --> 03:51.440
off you don't follow and instead you

03:51.440 --> 03:53.280
dive and chase something smaller just to

03:53.280 --> 03:55.040
see if you can catch it and when you do

03:55.040 --> 03:56.799
you let it go again without biting

03:56.799 --> 03:58.480
you're not hunting because you need to

03:58.480 --> 03:59.920
you're doing it because you figured out

03:59.920 --> 04:01.760
how you're 5 years old when you decide

04:01.760 --> 04:03.200
to leave your mother's group for the

04:03.200 --> 04:04.640
past few years you've been spending more

04:04.640 --> 04:06.400
and more time on your own drifting away

04:06.400 --> 04:08.159
during hunts swimming further than you

04:08.159 --> 04:10.000
should and now it just feels like the

04:10.000 --> 04:11.920
right time to stop going back you swim

04:11.920 --> 04:14.080
for a few hours following nothing until

04:14.080 --> 04:15.760
you spot a group of juveniles moving

04:15.760 --> 04:17.759
together across open water you fall in

04:17.759 --> 04:19.440
beside them and match their pace and

04:19.440 --> 04:21.359
when no one pushes you away you stay

04:21.359 --> 04:23.040
three of them stand out they break off

04:23.040 --> 04:24.639
from the group without saying anything

04:24.639 --> 04:26.320
so you follow them keeping just behind

04:26.320 --> 04:28.000
as they swim across a flat stretch of

04:28.000 --> 04:29.840
ocean that's when you bond you find a

04:29.840 --> 04:31.520
puffer fish and one of them stuns it you

04:31.520 --> 04:33.199
move in and let it sting you the effect

04:33.199 --> 04:34.960
hits almost instantly so you back off

04:34.960 --> 04:36.800
and pass it on one of your buddies bites

04:36.800 --> 04:38.800
it next and starts spinning clicking and

04:38.800 --> 04:40.560
drifting in circles you all take turns

04:40.560 --> 04:42.160
with it until the high fades and the

04:42.160 --> 04:43.919
feeling's gone then you kill it and go

04:43.919 --> 04:45.759
looking for more but this time one of

04:45.759 --> 04:47.680
the dolphins hangs back he doesn't bite

04:47.680 --> 04:49.600
he just watches from a distance you echo

04:49.600 --> 04:51.440
at him loudly pushing him to join in

04:51.440 --> 04:52.880
when he still doesn't move your friend

04:52.880 --> 04:54.639
rams into his side and knocks him off

04:54.639 --> 04:56.639
balance spinning him around you laugh

04:56.639 --> 04:58.479
and swim off without waiting he drifts

04:58.479 --> 05:00.240
behind for a while then turns the other

05:00.240 --> 05:01.919
way and disappears you don't see him

05:01.919 --> 05:03.600
anymore again it's just the three of you

05:03.600 --> 05:05.120
now and from that point on you don't

05:05.120 --> 05:06.880
swim alone anymore you're 10 years old

05:06.880 --> 05:08.320
now and you're still moving with the

05:08.320 --> 05:10.320
same two males you bonded with years ago

05:10.320 --> 05:12.320
you've grown stronger faster and more

05:12.320 --> 05:14.000
coordinated the three of you move like

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
one body now reacting before the others

05:16.000 --> 05:17.840
even need to signal you begin searching

05:17.840 --> 05:19.759
for something else a female to follow

05:19.759 --> 05:21.600
you swim until one drifts into view

05:21.600 --> 05:23.600
alone and slightly behind the others

05:23.600 --> 05:25.199
she's moving slow enough to make herself

05:25.199 --> 05:27.039
an easy target your group shifts

05:27.039 --> 05:28.880
position without communicating one moves

05:28.880 --> 05:30.479
to the left one cuts to the right and

05:30.479 --> 05:32.560
you stay behind she notices and picks up

05:32.560 --> 05:34.720
speed but the formation holds every path

05:34.720 --> 05:36.479
she tests is already blocked before she

05:36.479 --> 05:38.400
even tries she dives and your friend

05:38.400 --> 05:40.639
drops with her she spins and you match

05:40.639 --> 05:42.320
the movement she swims up toward the

05:42.320 --> 05:43.759
surface and finds one of you already

05:43.759 --> 05:45.520
waiting no matter which way she moves

05:45.520 --> 05:46.960
someone is there before she gets the

05:46.960 --> 05:48.560
chance you don't touch her you just

05:48.560 --> 05:50.400
follow always close enough to force a

05:50.400 --> 05:51.919
reaction but never far enough to give

05:51.919 --> 05:53.919
her space every time she slows the gap

05:53.919 --> 05:55.759
tightens you take turns keeping pressure

05:55.759 --> 05:58.000
on her one behind one to each side

05:58.000 --> 05:59.919
always rotating and adjusting the sun

05:59.919 --> 06:02.080
rises and drops again the group rests

06:02.080 --> 06:03.759
but she doesn't even when the ocean

06:03.759 --> 06:05.680
calms and the current slows you keep

06:05.680 --> 06:07.919
pressing in she tries to stop once just

06:07.919 --> 06:09.600
for a breath but your friend cuts across

06:09.600 --> 06:11.440
her path and she keeps moving it goes on

06:11.440 --> 06:13.280
for hours you've seen others do it

06:13.280 --> 06:14.880
you've watched the way older groups hunt

06:14.880 --> 06:16.720
in teams not just for food but for

06:16.720 --> 06:18.560
control you've watched and learned and

06:18.560 --> 06:20.080
now the roles are reversed now you're

06:20.080 --> 06:22.080
the ones being watched you're 15 years

06:22.080 --> 06:23.280
old now and you've learned that

06:23.280 --> 06:24.960
sometimes it's not about the female and

06:24.960 --> 06:26.560
it's not about the chase it's about

06:26.560 --> 06:28.000
reminding everyone that you're still a

06:28.000 --> 06:29.919
menace you see a group ahead of you all

06:29.919 --> 06:31.840
males surrounding a single female who's

06:31.840 --> 06:33.919
bigger than most she spins slowly and

06:33.919 --> 06:35.360
keeps her head down while they circle

06:35.360 --> 06:37.280
her flashing their sides and clicking

06:37.280 --> 06:39.039
fast like they're competing you weren't

06:39.039 --> 06:40.720
invited but that doesn't matter you

06:40.720 --> 06:42.319
don't care about her you care that they

06:42.319 --> 06:44.160
think they're in control you aim for the

06:44.160 --> 06:45.759
one nearest the edge and slam your head

06:45.759 --> 06:47.440
into his side hard enough to flip him

06:47.440 --> 06:49.680
over his skin tears along the ribs and a

06:49.680 --> 06:51.600
long red line opens up across his side

06:51.600 --> 06:53.520
he swims away and sinks into the deep

06:53.520 --> 06:55.120
the others stop spinning and break

06:55.120 --> 06:56.880
formation one of them charges at your

06:56.880 --> 06:58.240
shoulder and knocks you off angle

06:58.240 --> 06:59.919
another comes from behind and clips your

06:59.919 --> 07:02.000
spine with his jaw you spin to strike

07:02.000 --> 07:03.840
back but you can't land a clean hit you

07:03.840 --> 07:05.360
fight harder than you need to just to

07:05.360 --> 07:07.039
drag it out you take the hits and you

07:07.039 --> 07:09.199
give a few back then you twist low dive

07:09.199 --> 07:10.960
beneath them and pull out of the chaos

07:10.960 --> 07:12.720
with scratches along your tail and two

07:12.720 --> 07:14.639
fresh scars you leave the fight without

07:14.639 --> 07:16.479
winning but you don't feel like you lost

07:16.479 --> 07:18.080
the next day you're still sore when you

07:18.080 --> 07:19.520
hear something small moving near the

07:19.520 --> 07:21.520
rocks so you go to check it's a porpus

07:21.520 --> 07:23.039
calf young enough that it doesn't know

07:23.039 --> 07:25.120
what you are you echo once just to see

07:25.120 --> 07:27.280
how it reacts then you charge it doesn't

07:27.280 --> 07:29.280
scream it just takes the hit full force

07:29.280 --> 07:31.520
and goes limp you grab it once bite down

07:31.520 --> 07:33.360
hard enough to feel the bones snap then

07:33.360 --> 07:35.199
let it sink you don't eat it and you

07:35.199 --> 07:36.880
don't look back you just swim off and

07:36.880 --> 07:38.240
leave it there and for the first time

07:38.240 --> 07:40.240
since the fight you feel better you're

07:40.240 --> 07:42.479
25 years old now you've killed calves

07:42.479 --> 07:44.479
chased rivals torn open bellies and

07:44.479 --> 07:46.479
circled bodies that stopped moving hours

07:46.479 --> 07:48.080
before anyone noticed but you've never

07:48.080 --> 07:49.919
tried a human you see a group near the

07:49.919 --> 07:51.759
surface splashing around in a way that

07:51.759 --> 07:53.520
doesn't make sense one of them drifts

07:53.520 --> 07:55.360
too far from the rest too far to get

07:55.360 --> 07:56.960
pulled back in time if something were to

07:56.960 --> 07:59.039
happen so you circle once from below

07:59.039 --> 08:01.039
once from the side a little closer each

08:01.039 --> 08:02.800
time until they pause and look around

08:02.800 --> 08:04.240
but it's already too late because you've

08:04.240 --> 08:06.240
decided you circle until a narrow gap

08:06.240 --> 08:07.840
appears and then you swim straight in

08:07.840 --> 08:09.759
without thinking just acting before the

08:09.759 --> 08:11.759
moment disappears you bump their leg to

08:11.759 --> 08:13.440
see what they'll do they start screaming

08:13.440 --> 08:15.120
and panicking so you pass underneath

08:15.120 --> 08:17.280
them and roll once then rise up fast

08:17.280 --> 08:18.960
clamp your jaw around their waist and

08:18.960 --> 08:20.639
drag them down they fight and kick at

08:20.639 --> 08:22.160
your head but you don't let go the more

08:22.160 --> 08:24.000
they panic the deeper you pull them you

08:24.000 --> 08:25.919
hold steady while their arms flail and

08:25.919 --> 08:27.680
the last burst of air slips from their

08:27.680 --> 08:29.360
mouth in a string of bubbles that drift

08:29.360 --> 08:31.120
back toward the surface they manage to

08:31.120 --> 08:32.959
twist free but only for a second you

08:32.959 --> 08:34.880
grab their foot drag again and this time

08:34.880 --> 08:36.880
they stop fighting then you let go they

08:36.880 --> 08:38.479
shoot upward and scream before they

08:38.479 --> 08:40.080
break the surface the rest of the group

08:40.080 --> 08:42.000
rushes in pulling them toward the boat

08:42.000 --> 08:43.519
while shouting in sounds that don't make

08:43.519 --> 08:45.200
any sense to you you watch from below

08:45.200 --> 08:46.959
the surface as they panic and swim away

08:46.959 --> 08:48.800
faster than they ever did before next

08:48.800 --> 08:51.040
time you won't let go skip forward a bit

08:51.040 --> 08:53.360
and you're 29 years old you see boats in

08:53.360 --> 08:55.040
the distance lined up in a way that

08:55.040 --> 08:56.480
doesn't feel right you followed them

08:56.480 --> 08:58.080
before and it's always meant food so

08:58.080 --> 08:59.839
your group follows them without thinking

08:59.839 --> 09:01.680
nothing feels off until the clicks start

09:01.680 --> 09:03.519
to thin one of the dolphins beside you

09:03.519 --> 09:05.279
drifts to the edge and disappears then

09:05.279 --> 09:07.120
another cuts downward and doesn't return

09:07.120 --> 09:09.120
you echo once and hear only emptiness

09:09.120 --> 09:11.200
you echo again and the reply comes back

09:11.200 --> 09:13.040
wrong you swim forward and see the water

09:13.040 --> 09:14.880
ahead is red you turn and try to leave

09:14.880 --> 09:16.720
but the way out is already gone the

09:16.720 --> 09:18.560
boats behind you have moved the surface

09:18.560 --> 09:20.320
breaks and something crashes into the

09:20.320 --> 09:22.480
sea you dive fast trying to cut bath it

09:22.480 --> 09:24.160
but a net tightens around your belly and

09:24.160 --> 09:26.000
pulls your body sideways you kick your

09:26.000 --> 09:27.680
tail against the rope but it only gets

09:27.680 --> 09:29.760
tighter then you get pulled up a hand

09:29.760 --> 09:31.760
grabs your back you spin and knock one

09:31.760 --> 09:33.600
away but another catches you from behind

09:33.600 --> 09:35.200
you slam into the deck of the boat and

09:35.200 --> 09:36.880
the sound disappears they drag you to

09:36.880 --> 09:38.800
the edge and pull you off your body hits

09:38.800 --> 09:40.720
the beach you try to slide back into the

09:40.720 --> 09:42.320
water but your flippers dig in and hold

09:42.320 --> 09:44.080
you still you lie there waiting to

09:44.080 --> 09:45.839
breathe then they cut you open you feel

09:45.839 --> 09:47.519
it once then nothing they call it

09:47.519 --> 09:49.519
tradition and after you stop moving they

09:49.519 --> 09:51.519
kill the rest one by one all the way to

09:51.519 --> 09:54.080
the end over the next few days 1 1500

09:54.080 --> 09:56.000
more of your kind will die life as a

09:56.000 --> 09:57.600
dolphin might be rough but there's

09:57.600 --> 09:59.360
another animal out there that has it way

09:59.360 --> 10:02.080
worse trust me it's wild check out the

10:02.080 --> 10:05.760
video and see for yourself
